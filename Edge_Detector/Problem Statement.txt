Build a circuit that pulses dout one cycle after the rising edge of din. A pulse is defined as writing a single-cycle. When resetn is asserted, the value of din should be treated as 0.

*Even if din maintains a value of 1 for mulitple cycles after its rising edge, dout's pulse should only last for exactly one cycle.

*If din has multiple rising edges, dout will have multiple pulses.

*If resetn goes low in the same cycle as the input's rising edge, the resetn specification takes priority. This means the output is 0, instead of a pulse.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
din - Input signal
dout - Output signal
Output signals during reset
dout - 0 when resetn is active
